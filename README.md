# CanCantHUB (TESTING)
I was just having fun making a HUB for Roblox, now I'm making it for Universal (can be used in all games) and in the future I will add support for other games

### PLAYER (Universal)

- WalkSpeed - Slider | Change the WalkSpeed value to up to 500
- JumpPower - Slider | Change the JumpPower value to up to 500
- ESP - Toggle | ESP color will automatically change depending on the team color, and if there is no team the color will be white (default)
